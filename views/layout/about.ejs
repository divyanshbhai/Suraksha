<h2>About Suraksha – Your Digital Companion for Safety</h2>
<p>Suraksha is a women safety web application created with a single purpose — to help women feel safe, empowered, and supported in public spaces.
    We believe that every woman has the right to live without fear and report incidents without shame or judgment.
    
    Through Suraksha, users can:
    <ul>
        <li>📍 Anonymously report incidents like harassment, unsafe areas, or suspicious behavior.</li>
        <li>💬 Chat with Tara, our friendly AI assistant, for guidance, safety tips, and mental support.</li>
        <li>📊 View heatmaps of reported areas to avoid unsafe zones.</li>
    </ul>
    
    Whether you're walking alone, traveling late, or feeling uncomfortable in a space — Suraksha is here for you.
    This app was built during a 24-hour hackathon with one goal in mind: to use technology for real-world safety.
    
    We’re proud to make a step toward a world where women don’t just survive — they feel safe, heard, and supported.
</p>

<h3>🧠 Why We Built Suraksha</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Many women don’t report incidents due to fear or shame.</li>
    <li>Existing systems are slow or difficult to access.</li>
    <li>Safety tools often lack emotional or instant support.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Suraksha fills this gap</b> — with simplicity, privacy, and technology.</p>
<br>
<h3>💬 Meet Tara – Your Digital Assistant</h3>
<p>Tara is the heart of Suraksha — our AI chatbot who listens, understands, and helps you calmly.

<h3>🛡️ Our Promise</h3>
<p>Your safety and privacy come first. <br>
    We do not track, do not judge, and do not store any personal data unless the user chooses to share it.</p>
